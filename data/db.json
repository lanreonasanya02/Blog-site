      "body": "Python is a simple, yet powerful programming language that bridges the gap between C and shell programming, and is thus ideally suited for 'throw-away programming' and rapid prototyping. Python is also suitable as an extension language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or window managers. Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX, Amoeba, the Apple Macintosh O.S., and MS-DOS. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but as the examples are self- contained, the tutorial can be read off-line as well. For a description of standard objects and modules, see the Python Library Reference manual. The Python Reference Manual gives a more formal definition of the language.",
